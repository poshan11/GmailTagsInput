# GmailTagsInput

This is an HTML component that mocks google email input tags.
It has following features:
1. You can type any text in the textbox and on giving space, a tag is created. 
2. Clicking “X” will delete the corresponding tag.
3. Pressing back space highlights the last tag and hitting one more back
space or delete button deletes it.
4. Supports only valid gmail tags.

2. Start typing any gmail address in the box.
